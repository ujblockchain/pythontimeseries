# SARChI - Python: Time Series Analysis
South Africa-Switzerland Bilateral Research Chair in Blockchain Technology aims to explore blockchain integrations with real-world applications and development in Agric-food.

## Context
As a research center, our focus is more than just blockchain technology, but we have expertise in web development, data analysis, data science, and machine learning development. In this repository, look at a niche area of data science and machine learning engineering, **time series forecasting**. We use the fundamental gained from our [Python fundamentals series] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_gQrQhKkBE&list=PLYAUzWboAWPh0Tbm1MTYiPtF3QVm1ePlW), and apply it to Demand Forecasting.
